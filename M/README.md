The purpose of this test is to assess your level of preparation in problem-solving, data structures,  basic OO, and the Java programming language. For each of the problems below, write the simplest,  clearest solution you can, in the form of a short program. You will be writing your code with the help of  a Java compiler and the Eclipse development environment; you will not, however, have access to the  internet. 

Because a compiler has been provided, it is expected that  the code you submit for each of the problems will be free of compilation errors and will be a fully  functioning program. If a solution that you submit has compilation errors, you will not receive credit for  that problem. 

Initially, you will receive startup code for each problem. Your task is to add new code to the startup  code to meet requirements that are specified in the instructions below. Do not change the names of the  methods in the startup code (though you may add new methods if you want) and do not change their  signatures or access modifiers (e.g. public)).
